# [Song Year: Guess The Year!](https://matthewsoftware.pythonanywhere.com)
## A game where you're shown a YouTube video fo a popular song and you must guess the year it was released.

## How it works:
* Create an account with a unique username and a password
* Watch/Listen to a song with an embedded YouTube player
* Review your score, which is calculated as the number of years "off" your guess was (the closer to 0, the better)
* Guess as many times as you like, but only your first score is saved for each loaded song
* If you can't guess correctly, choose to reveal the year
* Keep track of your overall average score
* Notice the leaderboard of the 10 best average scores in the bottom left-hand corner

## Example:

Artist: The Beatles

Title: Yesterday

First you guess "1965":

Wrong! The score "1" is displayed. Your average score has been updated, and will not update again until you load a new song:

Before trying a new song, you reveal the answer: "1964":

## Known Issues
* Some of the song titles have non-recognized characters that cause a parsing error
