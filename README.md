## A game where you're shown a YouTube video fo a popular song and you must guess the year it was released.

* Create an account with a unique username and a password
* Watch/Listen to a song with an embedded YouTube player
* Check out your score, which is calculated as the number of years "off" your guess was
* Guess as many times as you like, but only your first score is saved for each loaded song
* If you can't guess correctly, choose to reveal the year
* Keep track of your overall average score
* Notice the leaderboard of the 10 best average scores in the bottom left-hand corner

Example:

Artist: The Beatles
Title: Yesterday

First you guess "1969". Wrong! The score "4" is displayed. Your average score has been updated, and will not update again until you load a new song. However, you continue with this song and guess "1973". Still wrong. But your score remains "4". Then you reveal the answer: "1965".


## Known Issues

* Some of the song titles have non-recognized characters that cause a parsing error
